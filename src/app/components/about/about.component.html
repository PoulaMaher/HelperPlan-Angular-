    We <a routerLink="/home">Helper Plan</a>, are a team of ethical
    professionals dedicated to the betterment of the job seekers and domestic
    workers. Founded in 2016, our online platform is designed to assist the
    employers as well as the helpers by enabling them to make informed

      Gone are the days when the domestic helpers were required to pay
      unethical, hefty fees to the employment agencies. At Helper Plan, we are
      committed to providing instant access to both the parties through well
      structured profiles, screening and a streamlined hiring process.

  <h2>Why choose us?</h2>
  <h3>Ethical</h3>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Helper Plan advocates for fair employment practices by connecting helpers,
      caregivers, and other job seekers with employers without charging the
      workers any fees. This approach helps to prevent exploitation and ensure
      that the workers are not burdened with debt before they start their jobs.
      We follow ethical practices and look forward to better our system in the
      days to come.
